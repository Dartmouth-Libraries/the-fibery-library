# The Fibery Library

Staff from Dartmouth Libraries wanted to encourage library staff and the campus community to engage and interact with library-specific data in an unexpected, creative way. Their solution? Combine metadata visualization and crafting with physical materials to think innovatively about the interaction between the digital and the physical. Introducing the Fibery Library!

## Getting started

1. Install the project requirements:

```
